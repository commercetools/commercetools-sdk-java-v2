# Versioning

The SDK is following [Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)

## Scope

As the SDK in great parts generated from an API specification, the release notes
may not reflect all changes in detail.

In case of breaking changes they are written out separately in the release notes.

A fix (e.g. wrong return type made a property not usable) which would result in
a compile time breaking change will be treated as MINOR or PATCH version change.

Other type changes (e.g. splitting a model to reflect differences between Read & Write models)
are treated as breaking change.

Binary incompatibilities are not regarded as Breaking Changes and not checked against.
